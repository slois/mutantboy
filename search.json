The greater the gradient the steeper a slope is.\nSuppose we have a line through the origin with a gradient \\(b=2\\). The line equation would be:\n\\[\ny = 2x\n\\]\nFor every point of the line, the \\(y\\)-coordinate is two times larger than \\(x\\)-coordiante. Applying the equation, the line could be represented by the following points:\nThe gradient or (slope) of the line is the ratio of the rise to the run, the change in y coordinate with respect to the change in x coordinate of that line. It describes the steepnes of the line in the coordinate plane.\n\\[\nb = \\frac{y_{2} - y_{1}}{x_{2} - x_{1}}\n\\]\nTo find the slope of a line, we need any two points on the line. Considering point \\((1, 2)\\) and the point \\((5, 10)\\), the gradient \\(b\\) is:\n\\[\nb = \\frac{10 - 2}{5 - 1} = \\frac{8}{4} = 2\n\\]\nA gradient of 2 means that for every increase in the X-coordinate there are two increases in the Y-coordinate.\nLet’s consider a new line:\n\\[\ny = \\frac{1}{2}x + 1\n\\]"
