As you know, the general equation of a straight line is:

$$
y = bx + a
$$

where *b* is the gradient and *a* is the value where this line cuts the Y axis or **intercept**. The greater the gradient the steeper a slope is.

Suppose we have a line through the origin with a gradient $b=2$. The line equation would be:

$$
y = 2x
$$

For every point of the line, the $y$-coordinate is two times larger than $x$-coordiante. Applying the equation, the line could be represented by the following points:

```{r}
#| layout-nrow: 1
line1 <- data.frame(x=0:5) %>% mutate(y=2 * x)
knitr::kable(line1)

ggplot(data=line1, aes(x=x, y=y)) + 
  geom_point(colour="red") + 
  geom_abline(slope=2, intercept=0, colour="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  expand_limits(x=-2, y=-5) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-5, 5, by = 1), minor_breaks=NULL) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-15, 15, by = 1), minor_breaks=NULL) +
  geom_hline(yintercept=0) +
  geom_vline(xintercept=0)
```

The **gradient** or (slope) of the line is the ratio of the **rise** to the **run**, the change in y coordinate with respect to the change in x coordinate of that line. It describes the steepnes of the line in the coordinate plane.

[the change in x is **run** and the change in y is **rise**.]{.aside}

$$
b = \frac{y_{2} - y_{1}}{x_{2} - x_{1}} 
$$

To find the slope of a line, we need any two points on the line. Considering point $(1, 2)$ and the point $(5, 10)$, the gradient $b$ is:

$$
b = \frac{10 - 2}{5 - 1} = \frac{8}{4} = 2
$$

A gradient of 2 means that for every increase in the X-coordinate there are two increases in the Y-coordinate.

Let's consider a new line:

$$
y = \frac{1}{2}x + 1
$$


```{r}
#| layout-nrow: 1

line2 <- data.frame(x=0:5) %>% mutate(y=x/2 + 1)
plot_two_lines <- ggplot() +
  geom_point(data=line1, aes(x=x, y=y), colour="red") +
  geom_point(data=line2, aes(x=x, y=y), colour="blue") +
  geom_abline(slope=1/2, intercept=1, colour="blue") +
  geom_abline(slope=2, intercept=0, colour="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  expand_limits(x=-2, y=-5) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-5, 5, by = 1), minor_breaks=NULL) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-15, 15, by = 1), minor_breaks=NULL) +
  geom_hline(yintercept=0) +
  geom_vline(xintercept=0)

knitr::kable(line2)
plot_two_lines
```

## Finding the intersection between two lines

Let's to write the equations of the two lines in the general form:

$$
\begin{array}{lcl}-2x + y = 0 \\ -\frac{1}{2}x + y = 1 \end{array} 
$$

This simple equation system can be represented as two matrices:

$$
\left(\begin{array}{cc}-2 & 1 \\ -\frac{1}{2} & 1 \end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{cc}0\\ 1\end{array}\right)
$$

From this relationship between the two lines, this equations system can be solved to obtain the intersection point that satisfies the constrictions of both lines.
```{r}
mat <- matrix(c(-2, 1, -0.5, 1), byrow=TRUE, ncol=2)

isec_point <- solve(mat, c(0, 1))
```

The intersection point is: (`r isec_point[1]`, `r isec_point[2]`). Green dot in the graph represent the exact intersection point between two lines:`

```{r}
plot_two_lines + geom_point(aes(x=0.667, y=1.33), colour="green", size=2)
```
